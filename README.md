To deploy this plugin in a production environment, the following steps are required:

1. **Secure Key Management**:
   - Implement proper private key encryption with strong salts
   - Consider using a Hardware Security Module (HSM) or Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
   - Never store unencrypted keys in environment variables or config files

2. **Blockchain Integration**:
   - Configure connection to a reliable Aeternity node
   - Set up monitoring for node connectivity and blockchain health
   - Implement transaction receipt verification and confirmation monitoring

3. **Security Considerations**:
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Add IP-based restrictions for sensitive operations
   - Set up logging and alerting for unusual activities
   - Consider multi-signature wallets for large transaction amounts

4. **Testing Process**:
   - Test transactions on testnet before mainnet deployment
   - Perform security audits of key handling code
   - Conduct penetration testing of the API endpoints

By completing these steps, the plugin will be ready for secure production deployment with real transactions on the Aeternity blockchain.

```

## Configuration

Configure the plugin by setting the following environment variables:

```typescript
const aeternityEnvSchema = {
  // Wallet secret key (encrypted or hashed)
  WALLET_SECRET_KEY: string (optional),
  
  // Public address
  AE_WALLET_ADDRESS: string (optional),
  
  // Salt for encryption/decryption
  WALLET_SECRET_SALT: string (optional),
  
  // Network node URL
  AETERNITY_NODE_URL: string (default: 'https://mainnet.aeternity.io'),
  
  // Compiler URL for smart contracts
  AETERNITY_COMPILER_URL: string (default: 'https://compiler.aeternity.io'),
  
  // Network ID
  AETERNITY_NETWORK_ID: string (default: 'ae_mainnet'),
  
  // Explorer API URL
  AETERNITY_EXPLORER_URL: string (default: 'https://explorer.aeternity.io/api'),
};
```

## Usage

### Basic Setup

```typescript
import { initializeRuntime } from 'elizaos';
import { aeternityPlugin } from '@elizaos/plugin-aeternity';

// Initialize the plugin
const runtime = await initializeRuntime({
  plugins: [aeternityPlugin],
});
```

### Key Management

Generate a new key pair:

```typescript
// Example usage
const result = await runtime.executeAction('GENERATE_KEY_PAIR', {
  password: 'securePassword123',
  securityLevel: 'high', // 'low', 'medium', 'high', or 'tee'
});

console.log('Public Key:', result.publicKey);
console.log('Encrypted Private Key:', result.encryptedPrivateKey);
```

### Transfer AE Tokens

Send AE tokens to another address:

```typescript
// Example usage
const result = await runtime.executeAction('TRANSFER_AE', {
  recipient: 'ak_recipientAddressHere',
  amount: '1.5', // Amount in AE
  options: {
    fee: '0.00002', // Optional custom fee
  },
});

console.log('Transaction Hash:', result.hash);
```

### Tip Telegram Users

Send AE tokens as tips to Telegram users:

```typescript
// Example usage - with direct wallet address
const result = await runtime.executeAction('TIP_TELEGRAM_USER', {
  recipient: 'ak_recipientAddressHere', // Recipient wallet address
  amount: '0.1', // Amount in AE
  message: 'Thanks for your helpful answer!', // Optional message
  chatId: 'your_group_chat_id', // Optional group chat ID for notifications
});

// With Telegram username
const result = await runtime.executeAction('TIP_TELEGRAM_USER', {
  recipient: '@telegramUsername', // Telegram username
  amount: '0.1', // Amount in AE
  message: 'Thanks for your helpful answer!', // Optional message
  chatId: 'your_group_chat_id', // Optional group chat ID for notifications
});
```

If the user hasn't registered an address yet:
1. The bot will send a DM to the user requesting their Aeternity address
2. The bot will send a message in the group chat notifying the user to check their DMs
3. The tip will be stored as "pending"
4. When the user responds with their address, the pending tip will be processed

### Process Address Registration

When a user sends their Aeternity address, process it and handle any pending tips:

```typescript
// Example usage
const result = await runtime.executeAction('PROCESS_ADDRESS_REGISTRATION', {
  username: 'telegramUsername', // Without @ prefix
  address: 'ak_recipientAddressHere',
  chatId: 'your_group_chat_id', // Optional group chat ID for notifications
});

console.log('Processed tips:', result.pendingTipsProcessed);
```

### Analyze Contributions

Analyze a contribution description to determine its level and recommended tip amount:

```typescript
// Example usage
const result = await runtime.executeAction('ANALYZE_CONTRIBUTION', {
  description: 'This detailed explanation about smart contract security was very helpful and saved me hours of debugging.',
  contributor: 'expert_user', // Optional
  type: 'TECHNICAL_EXPLANATION', // Optional
  context: 'In response to a question about contract vulnerabilities' // Optional
});

console.log('Contribution Level:', result.analysis.level);
console.log('Suggested Tip Amount:', result.suggestedTipAmount);
console.log('Confidence Score:', result.analysis.confidenceScore);
```

You can also use contribution descriptions when tipping, without specifying an amount:

```typescript
// Tip with auto-calculated amount based on contribution description
const result = await runtime.executeAction('TIP_TELEGRAM_USER', {
  recipient: '@expert_user',
  contributionDescription: 'Great explanation of how state channels work. The examples were very clear and helped me understand the concept completely.',
  message: 'Thank you for your detailed explanation!',
  chatId: 'your_group_chat_id' // Optional
});

console.log('Tip Amount:', result.tipAmount);
console.log('Contribution Level:', result.contributionLevel);
```

### Customize Tip Amounts

You can customize the tip amounts for each contribution level:

```typescript
// Get the contribution analyzer provider
const contributionAnalyzer = await runtime.getProvider('contributionAnalyzer');

// Set custom tip amounts
contributionAnalyzer.setTipAmounts({
  minor: '0.2',        // 0.2 AE for minor contributions
  helpful: '0.75',     // 0.75 AE for helpful contributions
  valuable: '2.0',     // 2.0 AE for valuable contributions
  major: '5.0',        // 5.0 AE for major contributions
  exceptional: '10.0'  // 10.0 AE for exceptional contributions
});
```

## Telegram Bot Integration

To use this plugin with a Telegram bot for tipping:

1. Use the ElizaOS Telegram client
2. Configure the bot to recognize tipping commands
3. The plugin automatically handles message processing for address registration
4. Call the TIP_TELEGRAM_USER action when appropriate, providing the group chat ID

Example character configuration:
```json
{
  "name": "AeTipBot",
  "capabilities": ["can_tip_users", "can_analyze_contributions"],
  "clients": ["telegram"],
  "actions": [
    {
      "name": "TIP_TELEGRAM_USER",
      "description": "Tip a user with AE tokens",
      "plugin": "aeternity"
    },
    {
      "name": "PROCESS_ADDRESS_REGISTRATION",
      "description": "Register an Aeternity address for a user",
      "plugin": "aeternity" 
    },
    {
      "name": "ANALYZE_CONTRIBUTION",
      "description": "Analyze a contribution to determine its value and appropriate tip amount",
      "plugin": "aeternity"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Development Notes

### TypeScript Errors

When developing the plugin, you may encounter these TypeScript errors:

1. **Missing elizaos Module**
   
   Error: `Cannot find module 'elizaos' or its corresponding type declarations`
   
   This error is expected during development as the 'elizaos' module is only available in the ElizaOS runtime environment. We've added mock type declarations in `src/types/elizaos.d.ts` to prevent TypeScript errors during development.

2. **ContributionAnalyzerService Runtime Parameter**
   
   Error: `Expected 1-2 arguments, but got 0` or `An argument for 'runtime' was not provided`
   
   The ContributionAnalyzerService requires the ElizaOS runtime to be passed as a parameter for accessing LLM capabilities. When running in the actual ElizaOS environment, this parameter will be available. The service includes fallback mechanisms for keyword-based analysis when the LLM is not available.

### Testing Without ElizaOS

For testing without an ElizaOS environment:

1. The service will fall back to keyword-based analysis when the LLM is not available
2. You can create mock implementations of the runtime interfaces for testing
3. Refer to the `examples` directory for demonstration code

See the [examples README](./examples/README.md) for more details on running the examples.

## Provider Access

Access the wallet provider directly:

```typescript
// Get the wallet provider
const walletProvider = await runtime.getProvider('aeternityWallet');

// Get wallet address
const address = await walletProvider.getAddress();

// Get wallet balance
const balance = await walletProvider.getBalance();

console.log(`Address: ${address}, Balance: ${balance} AE`);
```

Access the user address service:

```typescript
// Get the user address service
const userAddressService = await runtime.getProvider('aeternityUserAddress');

// Get address for a Telegram user
const address = userAddressService.getAddress('telegramUsername');

// Store an address for a user
userAddressService.storeAddress('telegramUsername', 'ak_address');

// Check pending tips
const pendingTips = userAddressService.getPendingTips('telegramUsername');
```

## How Telegram Tipping Works

1. **User Makes Valuable Contribution** - Someone in your Telegram community shares helpful information
2. **Bot Sends Tip** - Your bot decides to tip this user with `TIP_TELEGRAM_USER` action
3. **Group Notification** - Bot announces in the group chat that the user has been tipped and should check their DMs
4. **Address Request** - The bot sends the user a DM requesting their Aeternity address
5. **User Registers Address** - User replies with their Aeternity address
6. **Address Confirmed** - Bot announces in the group that the user has registered their address
7. **Pending Tips Processed** - All pending tips are automatically sent to the user's address
8. **Success Notification** - Bot sends confirmation messages in both DM and group chat
9. **Future Tips** - Next time the user is tipped, their address is already known

## Group Chat Notifications

The plugin sends the following notifications to group chats:

1. **When Tipping a User Without Address**:
   ```
   @username, someone wants to tip you with AE tokens! I've sent you a direct message - please check your DMs and reply with your Aeternity address to receive your tip.
   ```

2. **When a User Registers an Address (No Pending Tips)**:
   ```
   @username has registered their Aeternity address and is now ready to receive tips! 🎉
   ```

3. **When a User Registers an Address (With Pending Tips)**:
   ```
   🎉 @username has registered their Aeternity address and received 3 pending tips totaling 1.5000 AE!
   ```

4. **When Sending a Tip to a User with Registered Address**:
   ```
   Tip sent! @username has received 0.1 AE with message: "Thanks for your help!" (TX: ak_2tfrsj5...)
   ```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Private Key Storage**  
   * Always encrypt private keys when storing
   * Use environment variables or secure secret storage
   * Consider hardware wallets for production use

2. **Transaction Verification**  
   * Verify transaction parameters before signing
   * Implement confirmation steps for high-value transactions
   * Use simulation to preview transaction outcomes

3. **Network Configuration**  
   * Use secure, trusted RPC endpoints
   * Consider private nodes for production environments
   * Implement connection fallbacks

## License

This plugin is part of the Eliza project. See the main project repository for license information.

## SDK Version Compatibility

This plugin is compatible with `@aeternity/aepp-sdk` version 13.2.2. Using other versions may require adjustments to the implementation, particularly in the wallet provider and transaction services.

The plugin has been updated to work with the changes in the Aeternity SDK, including:
- Using the new constructor pattern for `MemoryAccount`, `Node`, and `Universal`
- Implementing required account methods like `signTypedData` and `signDelegation` 
- Supporting the `sk_` prefix format for secret keys

## Dependencies and Compatibility

### Aeternity SDK Integration

This plugin is compatible with `@aeternity/aepp-sdk` version 13.2.2. Using other versions may require adjustments to the implementation, particularly in the wallet provider and transaction services.

When developing locally, you have two options:
1. Install the SDK from npm: `pnpm add @aeternity/aepp-sdk@13.2.2`
2. Clone and link the SDK repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aeternity/aepp-sdk-js.git
   cd aepp-sdk-js
   npm install
   npm run build
   cd /path/to/your/project
   mkdir -p node_modules/@aeternity
   ln -s /path/to/aepp-sdk-js node_modules/@aeternity/aepp-sdk
   ```

### TypeScript Support

The plugin includes TypeScript declarations for the Aeternity SDK, which may be missing in the SDK itself. These declarations are located in `src/types/aeternity-sdk.d.ts` and ensure proper type checking for the SDK functions.

### Mock Mode for Development

The plugin includes a mock mode for development that simulates Aeternity blockchain interactions without making actual transactions. This is useful for testing without requiring real tokens or network connectivity. 

In the `walletProvider.ts` file, we automatically fallback to mock mode if the SDK initialization fails, allowing development and testing to continue without requiring a proper SDK setup.
